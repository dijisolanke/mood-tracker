# This is a mood tracking app built using React
I built it because I find it hard to use a diary daily.  
This way I can keep track of my mood over time with minimal effort.  
I may add some functionality to be able to output a chart of my mood over time.  

## Technologies used
- React
- Styled Components
- Typescript
- Jest tests
- Vercel (Deployment)


# Getting Started
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`
if you want to run the tests

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
